Best Practices for Using venv
Create and Activate Early:

Create the virtual environment as soon as you start a new project.
Use a consistent naming convention like venv.
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Use a requirements.txt File:

Document all dependencies by generating a requirements.txt file:
bash
Copy code


pip freeze > requirements.txt


Team members can install the same dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Version Control:

Add the venv directory to your .gitignore file to avoid committing it:
Copy code
venv/
Upgrade Tools:

Always keep pip, setuptools, and wheel up to date:
bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
