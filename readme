so far this is just asking use for artist name then prints the top 10 songs
most of code is copied off Akamai Developer yt channel. How to use spotify api tutorial


top songs (topx, defualt 5)
let user choose between all songs, between top 10, inside album

also add something that just showcaeses top 10, then also that just showcases all albums (or topx albums)

want toi be able to hover over song names then song plays or song cover shown, then can click to play
